    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, I load the Scottish Haggis dataset and carry out an initial inspection to understand its structure and basic properties. This involves checking the shape of the dataset, previewing the first few rows, and confirming that all expected columns are present before carrying out more detailed analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes several key measurements recorded for each haggis sighting, such as:\n",
    "- species  \n",
    "- island  \n",
    "- nose length  \n",
    "- eye size  \n",
    "- tail length  \n",
    "- body mass  \n",
    "- sex  \n",
    "- year  \n",
    "\n",
    "This initial check helps ensure that:\n",
    "- the data has loaded correctly,\n",
    "- there are no obvious structural issues,\n",
    "- and the dataset is ready for subsequent cleaning, exploration, and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I examine the dataset in more depth. This includes reviewing variable types, checking for missing values, summarising numerical features, and exploring distributions of categorical variables. Understanding these properties early on helps identify any issues that may affect the modelling stages and informs decisions about cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, and encoding later in the project.\n"

    "- **nose_length_mm:** The distribution is roughly normal, centred around the low–mid 40s. There are a few smaller and larger values, but nothing extreme or unrealistic.\n",
    "- **eye_size_mm:** This also shows a fairly normal shape, with most values between 15 and 19 mm. There is some spread toward 20–21 mm, but no major skew.\n",
    "- **tail_length_mm:** This distribution has two noticeable clusters — one around 185–195 mm and another around 210–220 mm. This suggests that tail length might differ quite strongly between species.\n",

    "#### Observations \n",
    "\n",
    "- The strongest relationship is between **tail_length_mm and body_mass_g** (0.86). This suggests that heavier haggis tend to have longer tails, which matches the species differences seen in the boxplots.\n",
    "- **nose_length_mm** also shows moderate positive correlations with both **tail_length_mm** (0.65) and **body_mass_g** (0.59). This means these three measurements tend to increase together.\n",
    "- **eye_size_mm** behaves differently from the other features. It has moderate negative correlations with **tail_length_mm** (–0.58) and **body_mass_g** (–0.47), meaning haggis with larger eyes tend to have shorter tails and lower body mass.\n",
    "- The weakest relationship is between **eye_size_mm** and **nose_length_mm** (–0.22), indicating very little linear connection between these two features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, none of the correlations are high enough to cause multicollinearity issues, but the strong link between tail length and body mass may influence models that rely on linear relationships (e.g., regression). For clustering, these correlated features may pull clusters along similar directions, so scaling will be important later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Cleaning Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the initial inspection and visual EDA, the dataset is generally clean and requires minimal preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing values\n",
    "There are a small number of missing values in the dataset:\n",
    "- 2 missing values in each of the numerical measurement columns  \n",
    "  (nose length, eye size, tail length, body mass)\n",
    "- 10 missing values in the `sex` column\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the amount of missing data is very small and appears random, I do not remove any rows at this stage. \n",
    "Instead, I will handle these missing values later using **imputation inside the preprocessing pipelines** for the machine learning models. \n",
    "This avoids unnecessary data loss while keeping the pipeline consistent and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data types\n",
    "All variables have appropriate data types:\n",
    "- Numerical features (e.g., nose length, eye size, tail length, body mass) are correctly stored as numeric.\n",
    "- Categorical features (species, island, sex) are correctly stored as object/string types.\n",
    "\n",
    "No type conversions are required at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outliers\n",
    "The boxplots in Section 3 indicate the presence of some **biologically plausible outliers**, particularly in:\n",
    "- body mass,\n",
    "- tail length,\n",
    "- and nose length.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values likely represent natural variation within the species rather than data entry errors.  \n",
    "For this reason, **I will not remove or cap these outliers**. Removing them could erase important biological differences that may be relevant for clustering and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I will account for their presence later by:\n",
    "- applying **feature scaling** before distance-based algorithms (K-Means, KNN),\n",
    "- monitoring model performance for sensitivity to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "No direct cleaning (removal or alteration of values) is required.  \n",
    "The dataset is ready for feature encoding and scaling decisions in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering can help highlight useful patterns in the data by creating new variables that capture relationships not directly visible in the raw measurements. Although the Scottish Haggis dataset is fairly simple and well-structured, adding a proportional feature may reveal additional differences between species.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rationale\n",
    "- Some physical measurements can be more informative when expressed as **ratios** rather than absolute values.\n",
    "- Ratios can help certain algorithms (e.g., clustering, regression) capture structural or proportional differences that individual features might not show clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Engineered Feature\n",
    "In this project, I create a new feature called **length_ratio**, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tail_length_mm / nose_length_mm`\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature represents the proportional relationship between tail length and nose length, which may highlight structural differences between species that are not obvious from the raw values alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature will be included in later modelling stages if it improves performance; if not, it can be excluded.\n",

    "### 5. Scaling and Encoding Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying clustering or classification models, it’s important to think about how the numerical and categorical features should be preprocessed. Different algorithms react differently to feature scales, and handling this properly avoids biased or unreliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scaling Requirements\n",
    "Some of the methods used later are **distance-based**, meaning features with larger numeric ranges can dominate the calculations. These algorithms work best when all numerical features are on a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms that **need scaling**:\n",
    "- **K-Means clustering** (Stage 2)\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** (Stage 4)\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** (Stage 4)\n",
    "- **Linear Regression** (Stage 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms that **do not need scaling**:\n",
    "- **Decision Trees** (Stage 3), since they split on thresholds rather than distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling plan:**  \n",
    "- I will use either **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler** for the numerical features.\n",
    "- For supervised learning, scaling will be applied **after** the train–test split to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "- For clustering, scaling can be applied to the full dataset since there is no training/testing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoding Requirements\n",
    "The dataset includes three categorical variables:\n",
    "- `species`\n",
    "- `island`\n",
    "- `sex`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs, so these categories need to be converted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding plan:**  \n",
    "- I will use **one-hot encoding** to convert categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dataset is in good shape and easy to work with. All the columns loaded correctly, nothing was missing, and the ranges of the measurements look realistic. The categorical labels are consistent, and the numerical values behave as you’d expect for physical measurements — no strange values or obvious mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histograms and boxplots show normal biological variation across the haggis, with a few larger or smaller individuals but nothing that looks like an error. These outliers seem genuine, so it's better to keep them. The species already show some separation in features like body mass, tail length, and nose length, which suggests these variables will be useful later for clustering and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation matrix shows some expected relationships (e.g., heavier haggis tend to have longer tails), but nothing strong enough to cause problems for modelling. Each feature still carries its own information. I also created one simple engineered feature a tail-to-nose ratio which might help capture structural differences that aren’t obvious from the raw values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset was already clean, there wasn’t much actual “cleaning” needed. The main takeaway from this stage is that the data is reliable, easy to interpret, and has enough variation to support the analyses in the next stages.\n"
