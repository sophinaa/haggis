# Scottish Haggis Project

This project explores a dataset about different species of Scottish haggis. The notebook walks through the whole process step-by-step: looking at the data, finding patterns, grouping the haggis into clusters, building models to predict species, and even predicting body mass. It includes clear visuals, explanations, and comparisons between different machine-learning methods. Everything runs in one notebook, and all the code is easy to follow. A few quirks in the data (like a mysterious "green" gender value) are noted and handled.
